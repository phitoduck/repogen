# ðŸ“£ Welcome to `repogen`!

The goal of this project is to automate the creation and configuration of GitHub repositories.

The idea is that any team working with Python could use this repository as a reference implemetation
and customize their own platform in a way that fits their team's opinions.

There are two components to this platform:

1. [`phitoduck-projen`](https://github.com/phitoduck/phito-projen), a library of Python-based `projen` "Components" (building blocks) for generating scaffolded Python projects
2. `repogen`, a CLI tool for creating configured GitHub repositories with boilerplate projects

## Quick Start

```bash
brew install nodejs # for phitoduck-projen
pip install -e .

# create a repository with a scaffolded python project, save the state 
GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxxx" \
PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN="pul-xxxx" \
    repogen create-repo <name>

# clean up the repository
GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxxx" \
PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN="pul-xxxx" \
    repogen destroy-repo <name>
```
